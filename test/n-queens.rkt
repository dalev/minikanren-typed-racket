#| 
A brute-force N-queens solver -- transliterated from the solution using
finite-domain constraints presented in 

  _cKanren: miniKanren with Constraints_ 

by Alvis et al in the 2011 Scheme workshop.  I've replaced the FD range
constraints with explicit [%member] calls, and the FD `all-different'
constraint is expanded into the O(n^2) disunification constraints.

(define (n-queens% queen-columns n)
  (define columns (for/list ([i (in-range n)]) i))
  ;; the i'th variable represents the queen in row i
  (let loop ([i n] [vars '()])
    (if (zero? i)
      (all
        (== queen-columns vars)
        (all-different% vars)
        (no-shared-diagonals% vars))
      (fresh (x)
        (%member columns x)
        (loop (- i 1) (cons x vars))))))

#| Hack alert:
[xs] is a _racket_ list of values; this is technically not a kanren relation
in the sense that [xs] is not a kanren logic variable associated with some
value via the substitution.

The procedure constructs the desired disunification goal in one pass rather 
than inferring it incrementally like the "purer" implementation below.
|#
(define (all-different% xs)
  (for/fold ([goal succeed]) ([x (in-list xs)]
                              [tl (in-tails (cdr xs))])
    (for/fold ([goal goal]) ([x^ (in-list tl)])
      (all goal (=/= x x^)))))

#| This is a "pure" implementation of [all-different%], but it makes the
   solver run a bit slower than using the above hack.
   (I observed a factor of about 5 or so for n = 6 or n = 7)

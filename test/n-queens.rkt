#| 
A brute-force N-queens solver -- transliterated from the solution using
finite-domain constraints presented in 

  _cKanren: miniKanren with Constraints_ 

by Alvis et al in the 2011 Scheme workshop.  I've replaced the FD range
constraints with explicit [%member] calls, and the FD `all-different'
constraint is expanded into the O(n^2) disunification constraints.

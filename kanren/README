The code in this directory is a port of Kiselyov et al's Kanren logic
programming system [1].  I've also integrated the results of Bender, Kuper, et
al [2] on efficient substition representations.

I've taken the liberty of lightly editing the original code to make it fit
better into standard Racket style.  And I also extended the unification
procedure to handle more built-in Racket datatypes.  Some of that code (e.g.
for unifying arbitrary structures) was lifted from Racket's racklog library.
